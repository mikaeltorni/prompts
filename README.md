Add the prompt file `python_programming_claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking.xml` contents to the Cursor User Rules for the instructions to become effective inside the editor.
This prompt is currently not optimized for agentic features inside Cursor.

# TODO
- When creating new files, automatically make a new class for the contents inside that file
- Optimize the docstring generation for new files, especially that they are classes now, and the prompt is missing instructions for those
- Automatic integration with the Cursor Agent feature to for example: write the requirements.txt file automatically
